    Hiroaki is a Japanese name that literally means 'spreading brightness'. It is derived from the 
    words 'hiro', which means 'large or wide', and 'aki', which means 'bright or clear'.

The intention of Hiroaki is to achieve clarity on your **API integration tests** in an idiomatic way by simplifying the way you **prepare 
your test environment prior to test execution and the assertions you perform in the end**. 

How it works
------------

It uses Kotlin features like extension functions, type aliases, delegation, package level functions and many other features 
like custom hamcrest matchers to achieve the wanted behavior.

When you are testing you want to isolate your tests from external frameworks that can provoke flakiness. 
**Hiroaki** relies on `MockWebServer` to provide a mock server as a target for your HTTP requests 
that you'll be able to use to mock your server behavior.

That enables you to assert over how your app or system will react to some predefined server & API 
behaviors. 

Usage
-----

Add the following code to your ``build.gradle``.

```groovy
dependencies{
    implementation 'com.jorgecastillo:hiroaki:0.0.1'
}
```

### Connecting your app to the mock server

Your app will query the real endpoints if you don't configure your retrofit instance to use the 
mock server url. To do that, you can wake up a **mock retrofit service** passing in your **service 
interface** and the **converter** you want to use. 

Finally, you are free to pass this mocked service to your `ApiClient`, `NetworkDataSource`, or 
whatever your collaborator using it is called.

Note that you'll also need to extend the base class `MockServerSuite`, which takes care of running 
and shutting down the server for you.

```kotlin
class GsonNewsNetworkDataSourceTest : MockServerSuite() {

    private lateinit var dataSource: GsonNewsNetworkDataSource

    @Before
    override fun setup() {
        super.setup()
        dataSource = GsonNewsNetworkDataSource(server.retrofitService(
                GsonNewsApiService::class.java,
                GsonConverterFactory.create()))
    }
        
    /*...*/
}
```
This will use a default `OkHttpClient` instance created for you with basic configuration. 
If you need further configuration on the http client, `retrofitService()` extension function offers 
an optional parameter to pass a custom `OkHttpClient`:

```kotlin
val customClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .connectTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS) // For testing purposes
        .readTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS) // For testing purposes
        .writeTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .build()

dataSource = GsonNewsNetworkDataSource(server.retrofitService(
                GsonNewsApiService::class.java,
                GsonConverterFactory.create(),
                okHttpClient = customClient))
```

If you can't extend `MockServerSuite`, **Hiroaki** also provides a **JUnit rule** called 
`MockServerRule` with the same purpose:

```kotlin
@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner::class)
class RuleNetworkDataSourceTest {

    private lateinit var dataSource: JacksonNewsNetworkDataSource
    @get:Rule val rule: MockServerRule = MockServerRule()

    @Before
    fun setup() {
        dataSource = JacksonNewsNetworkDataSource(rule.server.retrofitService(
                JacksonNewsApiService::class.java,
                JacksonConverterFactory.create()))
    }
    
    @Test
    fun sendsGetNews() {
       // you'll need to call the server through the rule
       rule.server.whenever(GET, "v2/top-headlines")
                  .thenRespond(success(jsonFileName = "GetNews.json"))
    
       runBlocking { dataSource.getNews() }

       /*...*/
    }
}
```
### Mocking Responses

With **Hiroaki**, you can mock request responses as if it was mockito:
````kotlin
@Test
fun chainResponses() {
    server.whenever(Method.GET, "v2/top-headlines")
            .thenRespond(success(jsonFileName = "GetNews.json"))

    val news = runBlocking { dataSource.getNews() }
    
    /*...*/
}
````
This ensures that **whenever** the endpoint `v2/top-headlines` is called with a `GET` http method, 
the you'll get a response like the one we are mocking there.

The function `success()` is a shortcut to provide a successful response. You can also use `error()` 
and `response()`. All of them are mocking functions that allow you to pass the following **optional** 
arguments:

* `code` **Int** return http status code for the mocked response.
* `jsonFileName` **String** resource file name to load the mocked response json body from.
* `jsonBody` **String** inlined json for your mocked response body.
* `headers` Is a **Map<String,String>** headers to attach to the mocked response.

If you don't want to use the `succes()`, `error()` or `response()` shortcut functions, you can 
still pass your own custom `MockResponse` from `MockWebServer`, the same way you have been doing 
until now. 

**Chaining mocked responses:**

You can also chain a bunch of mocked responses:
````kotlin
server.whenever(Method.GET, "v2/top-headlines")
                .thenRespond(success(jsonFileName = "GetNews.json"))
                .thenRespond(success(jsonFileName = "GetSingleNew.json"))
                .thenRespond(success(jsonFileName = "GetNews.json"))
````
* The first time the endpoint is called under the given conditions, it will return a 
`MockResponse` with the body obtained from the file `GetNews.json`. 
* The second time it gets called, it will return the second mocked response, which on this example 
is reading it's body from `GetSingleNew.json`. 
* The third time it gets called it'll return the third mocked response.

You can chain as many responses as you want, just remember that those **will be dispatched in the 
same order**.

**Dispatching dynamic responses**

Sometimes you want a response to depend on the structure of the request sent. For that reason, 
**Hiroaki** provides the `thenDispatch` method:
````kotlin
server.whenever(Method.GET, "v2/top-headlines")
      .thenDispatch({ request -> success(jsonBody = "{\"requestPath\" : ${request.path}" })
````   
With this feature, you could attach the same requesteded item Id to one of the items contained into 
the response body, for example. I guess you can imagine different use cases.

Feel free to combine as many `thenRespond()` and `thenDispatch()` calls as you want.
````kotlin
server.whenever(Method.GET, "v2/top-headlines")
      .thenRespond(success())
      .thenDispatch({ request -> success(jsonBody = "{\"requestPath\" : ${request.path}" })
      .thenRespond(error())
````   

### Request assertions

**Hiroaki** provides a highly configurable **extension function** working over any `MockWebServer` instance to perform assertions over your requests. Any of its arguments are **optional** so you're free to configure the assertion in a way that matches your needs. 

Here you have some examples:

Here I am asserting about: path where the request was sent to, query parameters, headers, and the HTTP method used.
```kotlin
server.assertRequest(
                sentToPath = "v2/top-headlines",
                queryParams = params(
                        "sources" to "crypto-coins-news",
                        "apiKey" to "a7c816f57c004c49a21bd458e11e2807"),
                headers = headers(
                        "Cache-Control" to "max-age=640000"
                ),
                method = Method.GET)
```
You can also provide a json body to assert over the body sent on your requests (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`). Here you have an inlined body used for the assertion. 

*Note that **It's mandatory to provide the network DTO you are using to map that body from**, since `Hiroaki` parses both bodies to objects and uses `equals` to compare the **expected** vs **sent** bodies. Therefore, it's highly recommended to **use Kotlin `data` classes** for your DTOs (following the standards) or if you don't really want to use them, you'll have to override `equals` on the class and all its nested levels.*
```kotlin
server.assertRequest(
                sentToPath = "v2/top-headlines",
                jsonBody = inlineBody("{\n" +
                        "  \"title\": \"Any Title\",\n" +
                        "  \"description\": \"Any description\",\n" +
                        "  \"source\": {\n" +
                        "    \"link\": \"http://source/123\",\n" +
                        "    \"name\": \"Some source\"\n" +
                        "  }\n" +
                        "}\n", ArticleDto::class.java))
````
You can also provide json body for post requests from a file saved on your `/test/resources` directory.
```kotlin
server.assertRequest(
                sentToPath = "v2/top-headlines",
                jsonBodyResFile = fileBody("PublishHeadline.json", ArticleDto::class.java),
                method = Method.POST)
```

### Parsed Response assertions
After any test that requests data from network you'll probably need to **assert over the parsed 
response** to double check whether the data was received and parsed properly.

To achieve that, **Hiroaki** provides syntax for asserting over equality, so you'd do the following:
```kotlin
@Test
fun parsesNewsProperly() {
    server.enqueueSuccessResponse("GetNews.json")

    val news = runBlocking { dataSource.getNews() }

    news eq expectedNews() // eq is an infix function for assertEquals()
}
``` 
Here `eq` Is just an `infix` function to run `assertEquals` on both objects. Here we are building the list of expected objects with the function `expectedNews()`. 
The objects are being compared using the `equals` operator so again, you **better use data classes or redefine `equals`** for your returned classes. 

Do you want to contribute?
--------------------------

I would love to get contributions from anybody. So if you feel that the library is lacking any features 
you consider key, please open an issue asking for it or a pull request providing an implementation for it. 

Any PR's must pass CI and that includes code style. Run the following commands to check code style or 
automatically format it. (You can use the graddle wrapper (`gradlew`) instead)
```groovy
// check code style
gradle app:ktlint
gradle hiroaki:ktlint 

// autoformat
gradle app:ktlintFormat
gradle hiroaki:ktlintFormat
```

Tests are also required to pass. You can run them like:
```groovy
gradle test
```
