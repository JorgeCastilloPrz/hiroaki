### üñº  Screenshots or Gifs

We include all the media files to give some context about what's being implemented or fixed. It's not mandatory to upload screenshots or gifts, but for most of the cases it becomes really handy to get into the scope of the feature / bug being fixed. It's also REALLY useful for UI related PRs.
