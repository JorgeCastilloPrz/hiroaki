*Hiroaki is a Japanese name that literally means 'spreading brightness'. It is derived from the 
words 'hiro', which means 'large or wide', and 'aki', which means 'bright or clear'.*

The intention of Hiroaki is to achieve that on your tests by simplifying the way you prepare 
your test environment prior to the test execution.

Usage
-----

Add the following code to your ``build.gradle``.

```groovy
dependencies{
    implementation 'com.jorgecastillo:hiroaki:0.0.1'
}

Do you want to contribute?
--------------------------

I would love to get contributions from anybody. So if you feel that the library is lacking any features 
you consider key, please open an issue asking for it or a pull request providing an implementation for it. 

Any PR's must pass CI and that includes code style. Run the following commands to check code style or 
automatically format it.
```
// check code style
./gradlew app:ktlint
./gradlew hiroaki:ktlint 

// autoformat
./gradlew app:ktlintFormat
./gradlew hiroaki:ktlintFormat
```
